# Research Findings: Intermediate Task Features for Todo App

## Overview

No specific external research was required for this planning phase. The technical context (Python, CLI, pytest, in-memory/file-based storage) is well-understood within the project. The feature relies on extending existing data models and service logic using standard Python capabilities.

## Technical Decisions

-   **Language**: Python 3.13+
-   **Dependencies**: Standard library, existing project structure.
-   **Testing Framework**: pytest
-   **Storage**: Continue with in-memory or simple file-based persistence for this phase, as per existing project context. Architectural decision for a more robust persistence layer (e.g., database) will be deferred to a later phase if required by advanced features.
-   **Platform**: Command-Line Interface (CLI).
